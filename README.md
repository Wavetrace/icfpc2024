All code is in code/ and utils/

Data is only tasks and solutions

* code/dfs solves the lambdaman with DFS
* code/decode_hs converts the inner language into executable Haskell
* data/efficiency/raw/conv2.sh uses sed to replace the Y combinator with `fix`
* utils/dec_3dtrace.pl uncompresses the text using Raku's long ints
